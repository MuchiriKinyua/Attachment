# Challenges encountered during the internship
i.	Exposure
Sometimes the employees would expect me to be knowledgeable in almost every ICT sector as they didn’t understand that the attachment opportunity was the one to provide me with the exposure. 
ii.	Punctuality 
It was really tough from me since I come very far from the attachment place. But once I got used to it I was able to plan ahead well to arrive at the proper time. i.e., before 8.00 am.
4.3 Areas of improvements when doing another attachment 
i.	Printer maintenance - The Company had to outsource for external developers since I was unable to develop it.
ii.	Software development – As a student of computer networks, I realized that I had shallow knowledge in the basics software development required for the general IT Technician.
iii.	Time management – sometimes I would find myself tripping out of the time schedule. 
iv.	Communication skills – in the company, I got introduced to different audiences and I realized that I have to improve on how to address different audiences. 

# Conclusions 
I offer sincere appreciation to National Museum Of Kenya for offering the internship opportunity. It was a great learning experience, familiarizing myself with the practical applications of ICT and security systems installations as well as gaining an insight in the real world requirements in the security systems business. Furthermore, I gained experience in various aspects that include networking, application installation, troubleshooting, PC maintenance and repairs. Even though the period initially seemed daunting, soon it became manageable. Further, through the attachment I have gained valuable insight, new concepts, and different work scenarios that I have never been exposed to before. Lastly, attachment has offered a wonderful chance to understand usefulness of ICT, its nature and value. Indeed, as I wind up my studies at school, I do trust that I know what the real world requires of me to secure a job after my graduation.
